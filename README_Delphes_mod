This version includes changes made to CheckMATE that allow the user to add custom delphes cards to the ./data/cards folder. It keeps the default delphes_skimmed cards for all existing analyses, while also allowing the user to change the delphes card if required.

In order to implement the addition of custom delphes cards for subsequent analyses, the following changes have been made:

1. Changes have been made to the ./tools/python/info.py card to define a new flag (set_custom_delphes) and a new parameter (set_custom_delphes_card), with the corresponding changes made to the parser function to take the flag and parameter value from the parameter input file.

2. The code block that sets the delphes_global_config dictionary has been moved from the fill_standard_paths_and_files() function to the fill_info_from_args() function. The lines are still there in the former, just commented out for now. Due to the order of function calls, I found this to be the most efficient location for these lines.

3. The all_params_explained.dat file in ./bin/example_run_cards has been updated to include the new flag SetCustomDelphes and parameter SetCustomDelphesName along with a brief explanation. If the flag remains uncommented, the default delphes_skimmed cards are used. If the flag is set to True, the user provided card is used.

4. Error statements have been included to account for the case where the flag is set to True, but the card is not found.

If you wish to have a look at the edits in info.py, please search for the keyword "custom" or "Mangesh", as the edits are in the immediate vicinity of these.
