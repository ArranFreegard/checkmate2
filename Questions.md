- Why are there always static member variables in python classes

- Why are old style Python Classes used? (advprint shows that code is Python2.7) 
	perks of new style python classes are:
		- usage of descriptors (
			@classmethod link in info.py -> is that why class Info inherits from dict?,
			@property for getters
		  )
		- compatibility with Python 3 in case of future upgrade

- Why is sometimes "f = open(xxx)" favored over "with open(xxx)"

- Number of PythiaHandlers in Fritz. Is it possible to have more than one PythiaHandler per Fritz process? 
	Torsten: Implementation offers the option to have CheckMATE trees in the future. Not really sure what exactly that means. Would that be a thing if reweighting was used?
